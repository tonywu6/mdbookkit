# Motivation

[rustdoc supports linking to items by name][rustdoc], a.k.a. [intra-doc
links][intra-doc-link]. This is awesome for at least two reasons:

- It's convenient. It could be as simple as [just adding brackets][uv-brackets].
- [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs) will generate cross-crate links that are version-pinned.
