# Known issues

## Performance

The preprocessor itself doesn't need much processing power, but it invokes
rust-analyzer, which does a full scan of your workspace. The larger your workspace is,
the longer mdBook will have to wait for the preprocessor. This is the source of the
majority of the run time.

There is an [experimental caching feature](caching.md#enabling-caching), which persists
query results after runs and reuses them when possible, avoiding spawning rust-analyzer
when your edit doesn't involve item links.

## Incorrect/unresolvable links

> [!NOTE]
>
> The following observations are as of rust-analyzer <ra-version>(version)</ra-version>.

In some circumstances, the preprocessor generates links that are incorrect or
inaccessible.

### Derive macros

Previously, it was possible to link to the documentation for a derive macro instead of
the derived trait by using the [macro syntax](supported-syntax.md#functions-and-macros),
for example, by writing [`[serde::Serialize!]`][serde::Serialize] instead of
[`[serde::Serialize]`][serde::Serialize].

This no longer works due to an upstream change. To link to such derive macros, you must
use paths that directly point to them, for example, `serde_derive::Serialize`.

### Attribute macros

Links generated by rust-analyzer for attribute macros end with
`macro.<macro_name>.html`, but they should end with `attr.<macro_name>.html`. For
example:

- [~~`tokio::main!`~~]
  - The correct link is
    [https://docs.rs/tokio-macros/2.5.0/tokio_macros/~~macro~~attr.main.html][tokio::main]

### Implemented items with the same name

Rust allows methods to have the same name if they are from different traits, and types
can implement the same trait multiple times if the trait is generic. All such methods
will appear on the same page for the type.

rustdoc will number the generated URL fragments so that they remain unique within the
HTML document. rust-analyzer does not yet have the ability to do so.

For example, these are the same links:

- [`<std::net::IpAddr as From<std::net::Ipv4Addr>>::from`]
- [`<std::net::IpAddr as From<std::net::Ipv6Addr>>::from`]

The correct link for the `From<Ipv6Addr>` implementation is actually
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/net/enum.IpAddr.html#method.from-1">
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/net/enum.IpAddr.html#method.from<strong>-1</strong>
</a>

### Private items

rustdoc has a [`private_intra_doc_links`][private_intra_doc_links] lint that warns you
when your public documentation tries to link to private items.

The preprocessor does not yet warn you about links to private items: rust-analyzer will
generate links for items regardless of their crate-level visibility.

### Items on primitive types

Links to associated methods and items on primitive types are currently not resolved by
rust-analyzer. For example:

- \[`str::parse`]
- \[`f64::MIN_POSITIVE`]

## Sites other than docs.rs

Currently, items from crates other than `std` always generate links that point to
<https://docs.rs>. The preprocessor does not yet support configuring alternative URL
prefixes.

## Wrong line numbers in diagnostics

When the preprocessor fails to resolve some items, it emits warnings that look like:

<figure>

![warning emitted that has the wrong line numbers](media/error-reporting-wrong-line.png)

</figure>

You may notice that the line numbers are sometimes incorrect for your source file. This
could happen in files that use the `{{#include}}` directive, for example.

This is an unfortunate limitation with mdBook's preprocessor architecture. Preprocessors
are run sequentially, with the next preprocessor receiving Markdown source rendered by
the previous one. If preprocessors running before the preprocessor modify Markdown
source in such ways that shift lines around, then the line numbers will look incorrect.

Unless mdBook somehow gains [source map][sourcemap] support, this problem is unlikely to
ever be solved.

## Resolved issues

### Since rust-analyzer `2025-08-11`

Previously, generated links to macros were often incorrect. These are currently
[fixed upstream](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/pull/20384) as of
rust-analyzer
[`2025-08-11`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/releases/tag/2025-08-11).

<details>
  <summary>Original description</summary>

Macros exported with [`#[macro_export]`][macro_export] are always exported at crate
root, and are documented as such by rustdoc, but rust-analyzer currently generates links
to the modules they are defined in. For example:

- [~~`panic!`~~], and many other `std` macros
  - The correct link is
    [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std~~/macros~~/macro.panic.html][panic]
- [~~`serde_json::json!`~~]
  - The correct link is
    [https://docs.rs/serde_json/1.0.140/serde_json~~/macros~~/macro.json.html][serde_json::json]
